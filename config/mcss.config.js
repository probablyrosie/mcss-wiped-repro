/**
 * This is the Modular CSS configuration file! It's used to help process
 * CSS files for use with svelte components. This config used to live alongside
 * svelte.config.js, but then some big changes happened with Vite and now it had
 * to split half of itself with vite, and the other with svelte.
 *
 * So here we are.
 *
 * This file exists because
 *
 * 1. SvelteKit now surfaces Vite, part of which uses mcss({ processor }), where "processor" is the
 *    modular-css exported processor
 * 2. svelte.config.js uses "preprocess" from this. It's weird, I know, but having this configuration here
 *    means we can change our css plugins and modify the build logic in this file instead of tacking it
 *    onto the rest of the config files.
